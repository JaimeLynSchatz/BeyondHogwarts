#### 3. (Free) Online Coding Schools/Tutorials/Sites
1. The classic: Codecademy (start here if Zed Shaw's site is too intimidating)
2. Zed Shaw's Learn Code the Hard Way sites (Python, C, Ruby, Git ...) (start here if Codecademy's oddness it too frustrating)
3. Michael Hartl's Rails Tutorial site
4. The Odin Project
5. Free Code Camp (more than a tutorial or learning site, it's a whole community to enable pair programming.)
6. Code School - first level for each course is free. You have to pay after that. If you have the means, it's worth it.
